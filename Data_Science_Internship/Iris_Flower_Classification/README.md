Iris Flower Classification

This project is completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship.
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their physical characteristics.

Objective

To predict the species of an Iris flower using sepal and petal measurements through a supervised machine learning approach.

Dataset

Source: Built-in Iris dataset from scikit-learn

Number of samples: 150

Number of features: 4 numerical features

Target variable: Flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Model Used

Logistic Regression

Suitable for multi-class classification problems

Tools and Technologies

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Workflow

Loaded the Iris dataset using scikit-learn

Converted the dataset into a pandas DataFrame

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained a Logistic Regression classification model

Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics

Results
