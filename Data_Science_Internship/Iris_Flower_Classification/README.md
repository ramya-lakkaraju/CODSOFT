Iris Flower Classification

This project is completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship (Task 3).
The goal of this task is to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species.

Problem Statement

Predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

The species classified are:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Dataset

Source: Built-in Iris dataset from scikit-learn

Total samples: 150

Features: 4 numerical features

Target variable: Flower species

Model Used

Logistic Regression

Suitable for multi-class classification problems

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Workflow

Loaded the Iris dataset using scikit-learn

Converted the dataset into a pandas DataFrame

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics

Results

Accuracy: 100%

The model correctly classified all test samples

High precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in solving classification problems using structured data. It helped strengthen understanding of model training, evaluation, and multi-class classification.
